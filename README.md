# Google-hashcode-2018

## Stage 1

I implemented a simulation/scoring system, which given 
* an input “data set file”, which contains the world parameters and the requested rides,  and
* a “submission file”, which contains the allocation of  rides to vehicles
outputs an integer that represent the scoring of the allocation contained in the submission file, according to the “Scoring section” of the specification document.

I have also written test for my application to test the basic functionality of the software.

## Stage 2

I developed a program that solves the Google challenge 2018, i.e. allocates cars to rides.
